In order to run this demonstration website locally, you will first have to install two packages: Flask and Flask-Cors. The easiest way to do this is using the requirements.txt file included in the repository here, which contains a list of all packages that are needed to run this application: 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

At some point, you will have multiple conflicting versions of Python on your computer, and you will need to use virtual environments to manage this. A good description is [found here](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/), and a good explanation for how to set up virtual environments with VSCode [can be found here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54106071/how-to-setup-virtual-environment-for-python-in-vs-code).  

Once flask is installed, you can start this application by typing `python3 backend.py`, as you would any other program.

The second command should start a server, running by default on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
